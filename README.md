####  Description

This data visualization project is based on the Chronicle. Rita.js did the grunt work computing of text analysis, to create a data set of key word and context word frequencies for five top articles from 2019. The visualization is heavily couched in HTML and CSS, the sketch sits right at the bottom of the scrollable, navigatable website. 

The visualization itself is based on the idea of the word cloud. The size of each ellipse and the word font is proportional to number of uses in the article. User interaction involves hovering over a key word of interest to see its context words, and holding the Enter key to see the word counts. An extension of this project would allow the user to choose their own online article and have that determine the layout/titles/background. Hopefully there will be more text analysis projects to come.
